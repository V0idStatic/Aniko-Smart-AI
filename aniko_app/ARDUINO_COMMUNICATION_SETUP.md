# This script outlines the changes made to enable Arduino communication

echo "ðŸš€ Arduino Communication Enhancement Summary"
echo "==========================================="
echo ""

echo "âœ… 1. Updated app.json with network security configuration:"
echo "   - Added NSAppTransportSecurity for iOS"
echo "   - Added usesCleartextTraffic for Android"
echo "   - Added INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions"
echo ""

echo "âœ… 2. Enhanced testConnection function with:"
echo "   - 15-second timeout handling"
echo "   - Comprehensive error analysis"
echo "   - Better user feedback"
echo "   - Device verification"
echo ""

echo "âœ… 3. Added debugging tools:"
echo "   - Quick test button for immediate testing"
echo "   - Network diagnostics utility"
echo "   - Enhanced console logging"
echo ""

echo "âœ… 4. Improved error handling:"
echo "   - Network request failed detection"
echo "   - HTTP error categorization"
echo "   - Timeout error handling"
echo "   - User-friendly error messages"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:"
echo "1. Rebuild your app (due to app.json changes)"
echo "2. Test with Quick Test button"
echo "3. Use Network Diagnostics if issues persist"
echo "4. Check console logs for detailed debugging"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting:"
echo "If connection still fails:"
echo "â€¢ Verify Arduino IP: 192.168.18.56"
echo "â€¢ Check both devices on same WiFi"
echo "â€¢ Test browser access: http://192.168.18.56/api/status"
echo "â€¢ Use Network Diagnostics button in app"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“± Expected Result:"
echo "App should now successfully connect to Arduino and display:"
echo "âœ… Connected to Arduino NPK sensor!"
echo "âœ… Live sensor data every 30 seconds"
echo "âœ… Database storage of readings"
